#### Customizing data visualizations using Matplotlib: 

##### Project Overview: 

This is a guided project that I did as part of the Data Analyst course curriculum on dataquest.io, we will practice recreating some of the plots using Matplotlib that Seaborn and Pandas allow to generate using high-level functions. 

We'll be working with the dataset from the American Community Survey on job outcomes for recent college graduates. You can read about how the dataset was compiled on FiveThirtyEight's Github repo @ https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors .

##### Development Environment:
IDE - Jupyter notebook (IPython Notebook)
Data File - recent-grads.csv
Data source - FiveThirtyEight's github repo - https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors
Programming Language - Python 3.5.2
Libraries - Pandas, Matplotlib

Here are some of the columns in the dataset:

* Rank - Rank by median earnings
* Major_code - Major code
* Major - Major description
* Major_category - Category of major
* Total - Total number of people with major
* Sample_size - Sample size (unweighted) of full-time
* Men - Male graduates
* Women - Female graduates
* ShareWomen - Women as share of total
* Employed - Number employed
