    ### Analyzing gun deaths in the US.
    The debate on Gun Control is a very contentious one, people on both sides of the debate put forth compelling arguments. Is there a way to approach the issue without any bias, well one way to do just that is to analyze any data related to gun deaths. Fortunately for the folks at [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) have already compiled the dataset which can be found here  https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data.   

    In this python notebook we will be analyzing and exploring the data to understand the demographics and social-economic factors associated with the dataset.



    The folder contains 4 files, viz.
    1. Basics.ipynb - ipython notebook contains code and markdown content, it uses the python 3.5 Kernel. The python code   uses lists (comprehension) and dictionaries to organize and categorize the data.
    2. README.md - Write-up on the project
    3. census.csv - Census data
    4. guns.csv - Gund deaths data from 2012 to 2014.
